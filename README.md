# Object_Identification_YOLO_Algorithm
Object detection using YOLO object detector

Detect objects in both images and video streams using Deep Learning, OpenCV, and Python.
I’ll be using YOLOv3 in this project, in particular, YOLO trained on the COCO dataset.

The COCO dataset consists of 80 labels, including, but not limited to:

People
Bicycles
Cars and trucks
Airplanes
Stop signs and fire hydrants
Animals, including cats, dogs, birds, horses, cows, and sheep, to name a few
Kitchen and dining objects, such as wine glasses, cups, forks, knives, spoons, etc. …and much more!
You can find a full list of what YOLO trained on the COCO dataset can detect using this link.

Installation
